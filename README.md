# simple.encrypted_key.fob.checker
read the README.txt file


This is a super simple code that pairs along nicely whit a xEM reader from dangerousthings.com
it can check for a single pasword but there is room to be optimized. We can probably add users lists, character hiding, better output secuencing etc.
It took me 3 secs. to code so donâ€™t expect nothing at all.
